# adversarial-reprogramming

### This is an implementation of the paper [Adversarial Reprogramming of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11146) arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.11146 (2018).

Simply run :-
```
python adversarial_reprogram.py
```

The code uses trained resnet-v2 weights to do the task of MNIST classification. It achieves a test accuracy of 90.67%.

To run the code you would need resnet_v2_50.ckpt file which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim)
